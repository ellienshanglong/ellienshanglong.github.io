## Lab dinner at Sichuan Pepper ##

Szechuan is area where panda inhabit in west south of china. It a basin area so the weather is humid. Because of this, people live there love to have their food to be spicy so that they can get the 'wet' and 'cold' out of their body. We have been experiencing a half year long wet and cold, I think it is a good time to have some spicy food like Szechuan people will do.
