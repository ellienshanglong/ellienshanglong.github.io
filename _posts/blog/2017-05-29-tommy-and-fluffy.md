## Our beloved cats ##

We found Tommy and fluffy in the Craigslist. Actually, we only saw Tommy was being post. In the post, Tommy laid on top of his bed. We contacted the owner and set up a time for us to give Tommy a visit. During the conversion, we realized that they let Tommy go because of they are going to move to new apartment is pet free. And they also needed to give away other cat Fluffy, but they have not 100% sure of this. At that time, we only plan to have a cat because we are totally new to have cat. But Ellie and I decided that if they give Fluffy to me, we will also take her, because if we only have Tommy, he will be lonely at day because we need to be school. We asked our friends Xiaogang and Manqian to go with us. They have two cats Sunny and Summer for two years. They have more experience with cats than us. After we arrived, Tommy came to the door to greet us, we saw his big beautiful round eyes and cute body. And we also saw the shy fluffy was being hold by the daughter of the owner. The family is big family with three kids. They are very nice. After a short conversion, we decided to take both of them. In order to make the transition smoothly, we decided to buy two pet carriers first.

When we came back with carriers, girls started to cry. Obviously they don't want cats leave them. We don't know what to do. But very fortunately, Manqian was an elementry school teacher and she knows how to deal with kids. She comforted the kids and said to them that we live 20 mins driving away and you can always visit the cats if you miss them. Finally, the kids let cats go with tears.

It was very easy to put Fluffy into the carrier. But for Tommy, it took us a while. The husband told me that Tommy is the tough one. Tommy shown his attitude in the way back to our apartment. He kept meowing all the way and never stop.

When we got home, Tommy and Fluffy went straight under the bed. And they hided for the whole day. Cats are sensitive animal wouldn't accept the new environment for in a short time. We set up food, water and litter box for them during day. Until night, the curious Tommy went our and explore our apartment. For the following days they hided during the day and went out at nights. Tommy was not a friendly cat to me at that time, I remember at the second day he scratched my foot and it was really hurt. The previous owner told us that Tommy won't let them to cut his nails which was really long when we checked it. We decided to switch to wet food for they. Fluffy adopted it very quickly but the stubborn cat Tommy still loves to eat dry food even after 1 year of eating wet food.

Later of the summer, we plan to have them checked at the vet. Everything went smoothly and when I got home, Tommy was so scared that he had an accident in the carrier. He is not that strong as he looks like.

Fluffy is such a wonderful cat. She will follow us everywhere and laid peacefully in our arms. She loved to be held. Tommy on the other hand he doesn't like to be held and we cannot even pick him at first. He will fight back and leave you a branch of scratches.  We have been trying to hold him. And now he gradually gets used to it.

Tommy is playful and outgoing. Fluffy is elegant and friendly. We are so luckily to have Tommy and Fluffy in our family.
